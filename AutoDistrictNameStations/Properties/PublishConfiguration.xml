## Description 

This mod will autoname public transport stations to be name of the District where it is placed. This mod also changes the platforms names, therefore in the route information it will actually show which train station (or whatever kind).
		
This is useful to make districts more useful, and also to provide more information in transport infoviews. 
		
## Usage

- Add a District, changing its name before placing the station.
- Add a station in the District. 
- If you already have a station of the same type in that District, the new station will get the name of the street.

Old stations will only be updated if there is an extension in the platforms (like in the train stations).
		
It works for: Bus stations (not signs or shelthers), Train Station, Cargo Train Terminal, Overground Subway Station, Underground Subway Station, Harbor, Cargo Harbor, Airport and International Airport. 
		
## Custom Format
		
You can select the station's name format in the settings of the mod (in-game settings).
		
If you want a custom format edit the follwing file and change the format of the stations:
		
```
%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\AutoDistrictNameStations.coc
```
